# Differences between if-else and swutch-case
The difference between these two is that in one you have only two conditions, 
which if it is true it will do one thing and if it is false it will do something 
else or simply do nothing, and in the other it is a menu control which you have 
several options and you can select the one that suits you best

# Differences between for, while and do-while

The difference is that ***FOR*** is to carry out limited cycles, which one determines 
how many you want it to be done as well as whether it increases or decreases and 
from which we are going to base ... it is also called a counter

The ***WHILE*** is always going to be executed as long as the condition is true while 
***DO WHILE*** is only executed once and then it is checked if the function is compatible
